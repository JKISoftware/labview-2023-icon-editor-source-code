Included is the source code and project to create the LabVIEW 2023 Q1 icon editor.  Do the following to install the code:

1. Rename <LabVIEW2023>\resource\plugins\lv_icon.lvlibp, the shipping icon editor, to lv_icon.lvlibp.ship to "hide" it.
2. Archive <LabVIEW2023>\vi.lib\LabVIEW Icon API to preserve the shipping copy.  Use your archive program of choice (e.g. 7-Zip).
3. Copy the two directories provided (resource and vi.lib) into your <LabVIEW2023> directory.  This installs the code into <LabVIEW2023>\resource\plugins\lv_icon.vi with associated support files.
